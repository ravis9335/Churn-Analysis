# Churn-Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company using Power BI to extract valuable insights into customer behavior, identify key churn drivers, and provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn. The analysis aims to help telecom companies understand customer retention patterns, particularly which customer segments are most at risk and how plan pricing impacts churn.

Key Objectives:

Analyze churn rates across various customer segments, such as age groups, contract types, and plan costs.
Use DAX measures to create calculated fields that identify customers most likely to churn.
Visualize trends and insights through interactive Power BI dashboards, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act upon the data.
Provide recommendations for customer retention strategies based on the findings.

Data

The dataset, sourced from DataCamp, contains records of telecom customers, including demographics, service plans, and churn status. Key features include:

•	Customer Information: Age, gender, group size, and state.
•	Plan Details: Contract type, payment method, monthly charges, and total charges.
•	Service Usage: Local calls, international calls, data usage, and customer service call frequency.
•	Churn Information: Whether the customer has churned, their churn reason, and churn category.

Tools and Technologies Used

•	Power BI: Used for data modeling, creating visualizations, and building interactive dashboards.
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized to create custom measures and calculated columns to enhance analysis.
•	SQL: Employed for data manipulation and querying.
•	Excel: Used for initial data exploration and cleanup.

Key Features of the Project

1.	Churn Rate Analysis:
•	Used DAX to calculate the churn rate across different customer segments.
•	Identified the age groups and plan types that contributed the most to customer churn.
2.	Customer Segmentation:
•	Segmented customers based on their demographics, plan usage, and service interactions.
•	Created custom DAX measures to determine which age groups were most likely to churn based on the type of plan and monthly charges.
3.	Data Visualization:
•	Built interactive Power BI dashboards that displayed:
•	Churn rates by customer demographics (age, gender, etc.).
•	The relationship between customer service calls and churn likelihood.
•	Monthly plan costs and their correlation with churn.
•	Visualized trends over time, allowing stakeholders to see which customer segments are at the highest risk.
4.	Insights and Recommendations:
•	Provided actionable insights to help reduce churn, such as improving customer service for high-churn groups and adjusting pricing strategies for certain age segments.
•	Highlighted at-risk customers, enabling the telecom company to target retention efforts more effectively.



Conclusions

This project provided valuable insights into customer churn for a telecom company. By analyzing demographic, service usage, and pricing data, we identified the key drivers of churn and developed visualizations that make these insights actionable. With targeted retention strategies based on this analysis, telecom companies can reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

Future Enhancements

1.	Incorporate predictive analytics using machine learning techniques to forecast customer churn.
2.	Add more customer interaction data to provide a more comprehensive view of the factors influencing churn.
3.	Automate report generation in Power BI for real-time churn tracking and monitoring.
